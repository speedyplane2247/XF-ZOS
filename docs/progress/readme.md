# Welcome to my Progress Chart!
Here I will document all progress I get done!
## 3/27/2019
Today, I came up with the idea for the project. I spent from around 9:00 AM today writing the c++ wrapper, (I already knew kTalk, so it wasn't unneccisary)
### C++ Wrapper
The wrapper isn't 100% complete yet, but it includes a 640 x 480 for viewing. The default option is scretching the output to fit. I'm also working on a console to manipulate the PPC CPU, send system calls, and simulate panics, missing BIOSes, and also allows direct access to the file system.
### OS
For the OS, I wrote the BIOS (Visual elements is in the OS, but the actual I/O system is in C++), a few error screens, and a basic GUI. I also plan on getting the Missing Resource screen done today as well.
